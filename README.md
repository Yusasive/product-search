# Product Search & Comparison App

This is a simple web application built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to search for products and compare them using a comparison table.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

### ```bash
### `git clone <repository-url>`

2. Navigate to the project directory:

### ```bash
### `cd product-search-comparison`

3. Install dependencies using Yarn:

### ```bash
### `yarn install`

## Usage

To run the application in development mode, use the following command:

### ```bash
### `yarn start`

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. You can also access it at http://localhost:3000.






## Deployment

To build the application for production, use the following command:

### ```bash
### `yarn build`

This will create an optimized build of the application in the build directory, ready for deployment to a web server or hosting service.



**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
